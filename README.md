# splash screen in an Android app that displays for 3 seconds before transitioning to the main activity.  

#  main activity of an Android app with a tabbed interface. It uses a TabLayout and ViewPager to enable navigation between different content sections or tabs within the app.

# gallery fragment that includes a button to open the camera activity utilizes Camera2 API to control functions such as flash, switching between front and rear cameras, and navigating to the GalleryActivity for media management.

# Once an image is captured, the user has the option to either discard the image, which will delete it from the gallery, or save it, in which case the image will be stored and displayed in the capture fragment
